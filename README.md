# Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation

This repo contains my projects on Data Cleaning and Manipulation, I have covered diverse topics under each project, You can see the description for each project below.

1)[A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/A%20New%20Era%20of%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20Baseball)

In this notebook, we're going to wrangle, analyze, and visualize Statcast data to compare  two baseball players named Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, we will use data visualizations like scatter plot, KDE, 2D histogram and python 'def' method to create functions for our 2D histogram.


2)[A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/A%20Visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners)

A very interesting project I worked on, over here we analyze the past Nobel Prize winners and try to draw various insights like 'How many male and female won the prize', 'How many of the winners were from USA', 'How many won the prize more than once' and 'How dominant were the winners when it came to country / gender', for answering this questions we used various data maniupulation techniques liek group by, value counts and also used Data Visualization techniques like Line plot, lmplot.

3)[AB Testing with Cookie Cats](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/AB%20Testing%20with%20Cookie%20Cats)

In this project we performed AB testing on a popular game called as Cookie Cats, during the game players occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In this project we analyzed by AB-testing whether is it better to keep the gate at level 30 or level 40 by analyzing various factor of performance.


4)[Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing)

In this project we analyze the popular Discovery of Handwashing by Dr. Semmelweis and how it helped reduce number of death among infants and preganant women, we used visualizationa and various mathematical functions inorder to conclude how much the discovery helped reducec the death rate.

5)[Exploring 67 years of LEGO](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20LEGO)

One of the first and basic project done by me, used simple data manipulation techniques to analyze colors of lego blocks and also the different lego sets build over the years.

6)[Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/Exploring%20the%20Bitcoin%20Cryptocurrency%20Market)

In this project we explore the data of Bitcoin Market, we see the market capitalization of top companies and analyze how volatile is the bitcoin market. We further analyzed to see at how much cost did the companies begin and how quickly their rates plunged.

7)[Exploring the evolution of Linux](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/Exploring%20the%20evolution%20of%20Linux)


8)[Exporing the Ames Iowa dataset](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/Exporing%20the%20Ames%20Iowa%20dataset)


9)[PROJECT WHICH DEBTS ARE WORTH THE BANK'S EFFORT](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/PROJECT%20WHICH%20DEBTS%20ARE%20WORTH%20THE%20BANK'S%20EFFORT)


10)[TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game)


11)[The GitHub History of the Scala Language](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Data-Cleaning-and-Manipulation/tree/master/The%20GitHub%20History%20of%20the%20Scala%20Language)
